# Hackathon Mandate Technical Sheet
OpenReg is tackling one of the largest problems of our generation: information overload. Our goal is to make researchers better at finding the information that matters. Our mandate is to help figure out which is the best way to cluster articles together. We want to group articles together that are too similar in content. 

We are going to offer you a data set and propose a few different methods, but we’re giving you the freedom to figure out which method is best at clustering articles together. Working on this mandate will give you experience in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) field. 

## Data
The dataset is in this repo. The dataset is composed of 3 columns: `URL`, `TITLE`, `TEXT`. 
Cleaning and parsing is required for each columns and clustering algorithms can be run on the cleaned up data. Visualization are more than welcomed. Clusteting could be done based on titles or texts. Clustering around urls is not what we are looking for. 

## Resources
Some tools you might need are [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/install.html), [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/) etc... Feel free to use whatever tools you need for data science and NLP.
